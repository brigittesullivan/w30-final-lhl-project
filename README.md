# Overview

The purpose of this project is to uncover insights into canadian lobster exports over the past 40 years, and develop a time series model to forecast future lobster export demand using the Facebook Prophet model. 

## Business Problem
* Can the monthly value of lobster that will be exported to the US for the next 3 years (2023-2025) be predicted?
* Some questions this project aims to answer?*
How has lobster exports evolved over time? 



## Assumptions:
* Data set covers 1988 to 2022. Will assume that 2023 is future since no data available. 
* Dollar will be adjusted to today's (2022) dollars
* Data for Homarus Americanus species of lobster(excludes Norway lobster and Rock lobster). Relevant HS Codes are: 
    * HS 030612 - Lobsters, nes, frozen, in shell, including boiled in shell
    * HS 030622 - Lobsters, (Homarus spp), not frozen, in shell, including boiled in shell (Retired 2016)
    * HS 030632 - Lobsters, live, fresh or chilled
    * HS 030692 - Lobsters, nes, dried/salted/in brine/smoked/cooked, w/n in shell 
    * HS 160530 - Lobster, prepared or preserved

3. CPI Data

# Findings


# Conclusion

Why are we better off...? 

## Next Steps

* build web app allowing real time selection based on commodity, country, province of origin, time horizon prediction
